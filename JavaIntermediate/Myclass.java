    public is an access modifier, meaning that it is used to set the level of access. You can use access modifiers for classes, attributes, and methods.

    For classes, the available modifiers are public or default (left blank), as described below:

    public: The class is accessible by any other class.

    default: The class is accessible only by classes in the same package.

    The following choices are available for attributes and methods:

    default: A variable or method declared with no access control modifier is available to any other class in the same package.

    public: Accessible from any other class.

    protected: Provides the same access as the default access modifier, with the addition that subclasses can access protected methods and variables of the superclass (Subclasses and superclasses are covered in upcoming lessons).

    private: Accessible only within the declared class itself.

            Constructors are special methods invoked when an object is created and are used to initialize them.     

            A constructor can be used to provide initial values for object attributes.      
                in bisaya - pwede ka maka initial ug values sa usa ka attribute / variable  
                two type of initial values:
                1. inside Constructor class assign the value of attributes
                2. with Constructor class in its paramet


            - A constructor name must be same as its class name.

            - A constructor must have no explicit return type. 
            Example of a constructor:
            public class Vehicle {
                private String color;
                Vehicle() {
                    color = "Red";
                }
            }

            The Vehicle() method is the constructor of our class, so whenever an object of that class is created, the color attribute will be set to "Red".
            A constructor can also take parameters to initialize attributes.

            public class Vehicle {
                private String color;
                Vehicle(String c) {
                    color = c;
                }
            }
            You can think of constructors as methods that will set up your class by default, so you donâ€™t need to repeat the same code every time.

        In summary, encapsulation provides the following benefits:
        - Control of the way data is accessed or modified

        - More flexible and easily changed code

        - Ability to change one part of the code without affecting other parts
         */

        /*                        Open this to show Information...                                             Inheritance  
         is like subclass or derived/child class is class inheriting / gi-liwatan kumbaga or na-liwatan
         super class or base/parent class is whose inherited in bisaya gikan-naliwat or asa naliwat
         ex. class Car extends Vehicle{}

         When one class is inherited from another class, it inherits all of the superclass' non-private variables and methods.

            additional: inheritance is like a ability on its class or identity

            Example:
            class Animal {
                protected int legs;

                public void eat() {
                    System.out.println("Animal eats");
                }
            }
            class Dog [b]extends [/b]Animal {
                Dog() {
                    legs = 4;
                }
            }

            Constructors are not member methods, and so are not inherited by subclasses.
            However, the constructor of the superclass is called when the subclass is instantiated.
        */

        /* Let's create a subclass & super Class 
            Subclass = Dog
            Superclass = Animal
         */
        Dog d = new Dog();
        System.out.println("The Dog born of "+d.legs+" legs.");
        d.eat();

        B obj = new B();
        obj.setB("this is String private B gikan kay superclass"); System.out.println(obj.getB()+"\n"+ obj.getA());
        
        
        /*                        Open this to show Information...                                            Polymorphism  
        Polymorphism, which refers to the idea of "having many forms", occurs when there is a hierarchy of classes related to each other through inheritance.
        additional: Same person can have different roles.

        A call to a member method will cause a different implementation to be executed, depending on the type of the object invoking the method.

        Here is an example: Dog and Cat are classes that inherit from the Animal class. Each class has its own implementation of the makeSound() method.

        class Animal {
            public void makeSound() {
                System.out.println("Grr...");
            }
        }
        class Cat extends Animal {
            public void makeSound() {
                System.out.println("Meow");
            }
        }
        class Dog extends Animal {
            public void makeSound() {
                System.out.println("Woof");
            }
        }
            As all Cat and Dog objects are Animal objects, we can do the following in main:
            public static void main(String[ ] args) {
                Animal a = new Dog();
                Animal b = new Cat();
            }
        We've created two reference variables of type Animal, and pointed them to the Cat and Dog objects.
        Now, we can call the makeSound() methods.

        */
        Animal cat = new Cat();
        Animal cow = new Cow();
        cat.makeSound();
        cow.makeSound();
