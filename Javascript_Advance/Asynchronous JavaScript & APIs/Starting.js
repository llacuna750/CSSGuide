/* 
1) What is an API?    
Application Programming Interface

2) How would you describe an API in your own words?
A tool that allows your code to talk with (use the goodness from) 
someone else's code. (Web APIs, 3rd-party package, etc.)

3) Can you think of an example of an API you've used? 
* BoredAPI - https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/ (getting data from a server)
* Local Storage (localStorage)

---------------------------------------------------------------- What is a Client? ----------------------------------------------------------------
○ Any device that connects to the internet to get data from somewhere (makes a "request").

- Any device that connects to the internet to get data from somewhere (makes a "request")
○ Laptop, phone, tablet, any "smart" device (watch, doorbell, robot vacuum, even a server!)

------------------------------------- What is a Server? ----------------------------------------------------------------
○ Basically just a computer. Accepts requests from clients asking for something, then responds to the client with that thing 
(e.g., an HTML page, an image or file, or just plain data).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) What are some examples of "clients" you've used today?
Laptop

Smart Phone

Robot vacuum

Smart plugs

2) How would you explain what a "server" is to a 5-year-old?
A computer that sends my own computer things when I ask it to.

3) In what way do clients and servers interact with each other? 
Client sends a request to a server, and the server sends back a response.

/* What is Requests - Responses Cycle
What is a Request?
-> When a device asks for a "resource" (data, image, HTML page, authentication token, etc.).
-> Requires a connection to the internet.

What is a Response?
-> The reply to the request
-> Could contain the resource (HTML, JSON data, etc.) asked for by the client.
-> Could contain a response saying the client isn't authorized to recieve the resource


1) What are 3 things your computer (client) might request from a server?
JSON array of suggested videos

Video stream

HTML page

2) What is the main job of a server?
Receive a request from a client and return a response.

3) Self study: What would the 3-digit server response code be if the server experiences an internal server error?
500 Internal Server Error
